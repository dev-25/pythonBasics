Numeric data types: These data types are used to store numeric values. They include:
    Integers: Integers are whole numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3.
    Floats: Floats are numbers with decimal points, such as 1.0, 2.5, -3.14.
    Complex numbers: Complex numbers are numbers of the form a + bi, where a and b are real numbers and i is the imaginary unit.

String data type: This data type is used to store text. Strings are sequences of characters, such as 'hello', 'world', 'Python'.

Sequence data types: These data types are used to store a sequence of values. They include:
    Lists: Lists are mutable sequences of values. They can be used to store any type of data, including strings, integers, floats, and other lists.
    Tuples: Tuples are immutable sequences of values. They are similar to lists, but they cannot be changed once they are created.
    Ranges: Ranges are sequences of numbers that represent a range of values. They are often used for looping.

Boolean data type: This data type is used to store Boolean values, which can be either True or False.

Set data types: These data types are used to store a collection of unique values. They are unordered and unindexed.

Dictionary data types: These data types are used to store a mapping of keys to values. The keys are unique, and the values can be of any type.

NoneType: Represents the absence of a value and is commonly denoted as None.
